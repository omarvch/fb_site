  first: Hello, my name is Fernando and I live in Montevideo, Uruguay.
  second: I am a programmer, I read comic books, play Nintendo, I collect t-shirts and like drawing stuff. This is my website where I just write and experiment with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
  third: I share some opinions and knowledge on my blog <a href="http://picandocodigo.net" title="Picando C&oacute;digo">Picando C&oacute;digo</a>, I try to post there often about programming, code, free software, and other things I find are worth sharing.

about:
  first: This site is a sandbox for me to play around. It started as a <strong><a href="http://rubyonrails.org/" class="tachado">Rails</a></strong> webapp. Then it became a <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com" title="Sinatra">Sinatra</a> + <a href="http://haml.info" title="Haml">Haml</a> + <a href="http://sass-lang.com" title="Sass">Sass</a> app. From developing almost static sites like this one with the mentioned technologies, I created <a href="https://github.com/picandocodigo/frankspace" title="Frankspace">Frankspace</a>, a small app to use as a mold for web applications.
  second: Right now I'm also using <a href="http://purecss.io/" title="Pure CSS">Pure</a>, a set of small CSS modules for responsiveness.

devel:
  first: I use <strong>Emacs</strong> as my text processor and developing tool (check out <a href="http://emacs.sexy" title="Emacs is Sexy">Emacs.sexy</a> a site I made about Emacs). I keep my <a href="https://github.com/picandocodigo/emacs-config" title="Emacs config files">config-files</a> on GitHub and have tried some Elisp for a couple of simple tasks, you can see the code <a href="https://github.com/picandocodigo/emacs-elisp" title="Emacs Lisp tests">here</a>.
  languages: <p>I've been using <strong>Ruby</strong> for a while, as it's currently the language with which I enjoy programming the most. I also code with <strong class="tachado">Java</strong>, <strong>JavaScript</strong>, <strong>PHP</strong> and am interested in <strong>Python</strong>, <strong>Scala</strong> and <strong>Clojure</strong> among others and I really like writing <strong>bash</strong> scripts and one-liners with awk, sed and grep.</p>
  second: You can see some of my code on my <a href="https://github.com/picandocodigo" title="GitHub profile">GitHub profile</a>, and here is some of the stuff I work on. This page is of course a work in progress, there's more up to date info on my GitHub profile.

  supertt:
    title: Super Time Tracker
    first: A web app to track time. You don't need to create an account, group or client. You don't need to share your e-mail address, name or phone number with the site. Just track your time.
    list: <ul><li>Website - <a href=\"http://supertimetracker.com\" title=\"Super Time Tracker\">supertimetracker.com</a></li><li>Source code - <a href=\"https://github.com/picandocodigo/supertimetracker\" title=\"Super Time Tracker on GitHub\">on GitHub</a></li><li>Web App - <a href="https://marketplace.firefox.com/app/super-time-tracker">on Firefox Marketplace</a>.</li></ul>

  wordpress:
    title: WordPress
    first: <p>I've used WordPress for quite some time, and have developed <a href="http://profiles.wordpress.org/fernandobt/">some plugins</a>. I don't maintain all of them, but <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/list-category-posts/" title="List Category Posts">List Category Posts</a> is still maintained and pretty popular among WordPress users. Some day I'll build my own blogging engine, soon...</p>
    second: <p>My profile on the <a href="http://wordpress.org" title="WordPress.org">WordPress.org</a> community is <a href="http://profiles.wordpress.org/users/fernandobt/" title="fernandobt">fernandobt</a>. I also try to to contribute on the WordPress Answers site when I can.</p>
    blogs: Some of my blogs using WordPress
    plugins: Plugins developed

  instantoh:
    title: Instant "Oh, the humanity!"
    first: A website I built for fun. I really like Herbert Morrison's report of the Hindenburg disaster expression for 'facepalm moments'. Since I couldn't find any, I created a button to get an instant audio of Morrison's 'Oh, the humanity!'.
    second: This same app was my first test for Firefox OS, I turned it into a Firefox OS app and <a href="https://marketplace.firefox.com/app/oh-the-humanity" title="Oh, the humanity! on Firefox Marketplace">uploaded it to the Firefox Marketplace</a>.
    third: <ul><li>Website - <a href="http://instantohthehumanity.com" title="Oh, the humanity!">instantohthehumanity.com</a></li><li>Source code - <a href="https://github.com/picandocodigo/instantoh">on GitHub</a>.</li><li>Web App - <a href="https://marketplace.firefox.com/app/oh-the-humanity">on Firefox Marketplace</a>.</li></ul>
