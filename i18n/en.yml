  first: Hello, my name is Fernando and I live in Montevideo, Uruguay.
  second: I am a programmer, I read comic books, play Nintendo, I collect t-shirts and like drawing stuff. This is my website where I just write and experiment with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
  third: I share some opinions and knowledge on my blog <a href="http://picandocodigo.net" title="Picando C&oacute;digo">Picando C&oacute;digo</a>, I try to post there often about programming, code, free software, and other things I find are worth sharing.

about:
  first: This site is like a sandbox to practice web technologies stuff. It started as a <strong><a href="http://rubyonrails.org/" class="tachado">Rails</a></strong> webapp. But using Rails had no sense, so it became a <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com" title="Sinatra">Sinatra</a> + <a href="http://haml.info" title="Haml">Haml</a> + <a href="http://sass-lang.com" title="Sass">Sass</a> app.
  second: From developing almost static sites like this one with the mentioned technologies, I created <a href="https://github.com/picandocodigo/frankspace" title="Frankspace">Frankspace</a>, a small app to use as a mold for a Sinatra + HAML + Sass + i18n web application.


devel:
  first: I use Emacs as my text processor and developing tool. I keep my <a href="https://github.com/picandocodigo/emacs-config" title="Emacs config files">config-files</a> on GitHub and have tried some Elisp for a couple of simple tasks, you can see the code <a href="https://github.com/picandocodigo/emacs-elisp" title="Emacs Lisp tests">here</a>.
  second: Here's some fun stuff I've developed. You can see more on my <a href="https://github.com/picandocodigo" title="GitHub profile">GitHub profile</a>.
  wordpress:
    title: WordPress
    first: <p>I've used WordPress for quite some time, and have developed <a href="http://profiles.wordpress.org/fernandobt/">some plugins</a>. I don't maintain all of them, but <a href="" title="List Category Posts">List Category Posts</a> is still maintained and pretty popular among WordPress users. Some day I'll build my own blogging engine, soon...</p>
    second: <p>My profile on the <a href="http://wordpress.org" title="WordPress.org">WordPress.org</a> community is <a href="http://profiles.wordpress.org/users/fernandobt/" title="fernandobt">fernandobt</a>. I also try to to contribute on the WordPress Answers site when I can.</p>

  instantoh:
    title: Instant "Oh, the humanity!"
    first: A website I built for fun. I really like Herbert Morrison's report of the Hindenburg disaster expression for 'facepalm moments'. Since I couldn't find any, I created a button to get an instant audio of Morrison's 'Oh, the humanity!'.
    second: This same app was my first test for Firefox OS, I turned it into a Firefox OS app and <a href="https://marketplace.firefox.com/app/oh-the-humanity" title="Oh, the humanity! on Firefox Marketplace">uploaded it to the Firefox Marketplace</a>.
    third: <ul><li>Website - <a href="http://instantohthehumanity.com" title="Oh, the humanity!">instantohthehumanity.com</a></li><li>Source code - <a href="https://github.com/picandocodigo/instantoh">on GitHub</a>.</li></ul>
